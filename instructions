To test the modified Python proxy server implementation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Setup an HTTP server**:
   - You need an HTTP server that the proxy can connect to and retrieve resources from. You can set up a simple HTTP server using Python's built-in `http.server` module.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files you want to serve.
   - Run the following command to start the HTTP server:
     ```
     python3 -m http.server
     ```
   - By default, this command starts the server on port 8000, serving files from the current directory.

2. **Modify the proxy server code**:
   - Replace `'www.example.com'` in the proxy server code with the IP address or hostname of your HTTP server.
   - Ensure that the port used in the proxy server code matches the port your HTTP server is running on. By default, it is set to port 80.

3. **Run the proxy server**:
   - Save the modified Python proxy server code into a file, for example, `proxy_server.py`.
   - Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the `proxy_server.py` file.
   - Run the following command to start the proxy server:
     ```
     python3 proxy_server.py
     ```

4. **Configure the client to use the proxy**:
   - Configure your web browser or any other HTTP client to use the proxy server you just started. Set the proxy server address to `localhost` and the port to `8888` (or the port you specified in the proxy server code).

5. **Test the proxy server**:
   - Open your web browser and try accessing some websites or resources. The proxy server should intercept the requests and forward them to your HTTP server.
   - Monitor the terminal window where the proxy server is running. You should see log messages indicating incoming connections and data transfer between the client, proxy server, and remote server.

6. **Verify proxy server logs**:
   - As the proxy server runs, it will print log messages to the terminal indicating connections and data transfer. This helps you verify that the proxy server is functioning as expected.







Access the Server:

Once the server is running, you can access it using your web browser or any HTTP client. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 
You should see a directory listing of the files in the directory you specified. You can click on files to view them in your browser.
